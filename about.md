<p>My name is San Min Liew and I am a senior undergraduate international student here at the University Of Minnesota majoring in Computer Engineering. My hometown is located in a hot tropical, multiracial, good food country, Malaysia. If you'd ask any Malaysian where would they bring tourists to the moment they arrive Malaysia, all of them would say "Let me bring you to x restaurant where they have awesome y food".
