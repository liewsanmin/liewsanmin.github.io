<p>My name is Joshua Liew and I graduated from the University Of Minnesota with Bachelors of Computer Engineering. I spent my entire childhood in a hot tropical, multiracial, good food country, Malaysia. If you'd ask any Malaysian where would they bring tourists to the moment they arrive in Malaysia, all of them would say "Let me bring you to x restaurant where they have awesome y food".
