I have joined many student led organizations at my [University](http://twin-cities.umn.edu/)
but my presence don't last for at most 2 weeks and I'm out. From laziness to low self esteem,
the excuses are endless. In January 2016, I decided to get my crap together and
commit myself to participating [Solar Vehicle Project (SVP)](http://umnsvp.org/).

All the advice about how joining student clubs will benefit you are TRUE. 6
months later, I am experiencing these benefits first hand and I'd like to share
them.

*Note : These benefits are specifically tailored towards engineering students
in particular*

## 1. Gain new technical skills
In these past 6 months I have to admit that I have gained a fair amount of
skills. I volunteered to work on creating a secondary pack from scratch for the
Solar Car. The use of the board is to essentially aid to kickstart the car for
[ASC 2016](http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2016/).
To do that I would have do the following things to make it happen
(in general) :

1. Understand how battery, charger works
2. Design circuit board
3. Research and choose electrical components for the board
4. Soldering
5. Programming the board
6. Lots of testing and debugging
7. You get the idea

I have learned how to design a circuit board using [Altium](http://www.altium.com/) from scratch, solder, program the
[STM32L4](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32l4-series.html?querycriteria=productId=SS1580) microcontroller and many more.

This project really takes a lot of effort but it is worth every second of it. To
illustrate my effort thus far. Enjoy the pictures below! :)

*Done!*

## 2. Meet like minded peers
Not only you'll meet peers who are like minded. Many of them can also teach you
valuable skills. The next time you have a question or hit a roadblock? They are
there for you!

## 3. Opportunity to deliver presentations
We have different subsystems in our Electrical Team. And each one needs to give
several presentations (Design Review, Schematic Design Review etc) before the
circuit board is ordered. I like this idea because it is very structured and
student members are able to ask / comment or even pin point any mistakes I made
(yea there's a bunch). I also find this a good chance to brush up my public
speaking skills.

So there you go, my top 3 reasons why joining Solar Vehicle Project is good. Till
the next post.
