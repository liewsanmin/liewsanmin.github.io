Few months ago when I was getting ready to bed and wanted to turn off the lights,
the usual routine started with complaining the switch being too far away. Then I
will mimick the 'spiderman move' to turn off the switch but that method never works.
Until one day it dawned on me, I could buy a lamp that is connected to buy phone!
Googled it, too [pricey](http://www.lifx.com/). Fine, I decided to make one from
the items I have in my room. I guess this is sort of a guideline to start building
a smart lamp. Enjoy!

Items required :
1. Photon MicroController
2. Breadboard
3. Resistors
4. Capacitors
5. Wires
6. Leds



steps
- assembling circuit
- coding
- testing
- done
- see you again!
