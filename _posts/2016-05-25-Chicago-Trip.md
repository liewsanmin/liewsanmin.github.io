My girlfriend and I had a fun getaway on a road trip to Chicago.

## 1st day

  So, I have 2 main goals for this trip. The first one is the hotel we booked. I
  just love hotel designs and their customer service. Their beds are just too
  comfortable! The second goal for me would be food, I just want
  to enjoy. Food.

  We packed our stuff, get in the car and off we go on the road trip. I was a
  little anxious for my car because well, this is my first time driving 6 hours
  on my own and it will be troublesome to fix my car if it gets down to that.
  Anyway, look how beautiful it is from the inside!

  After about 6 hours of drive and settling at Sheraton Hotel (yes, it is
  as wonderful as I thought it would be, too bad we did not take pictures when
  it was tidy!). We went straight to Woo Chon restaurant to have our favorite
  Korean BBQ. Yelp helped us a lot and we did not regret coming to this
  restaurant. The meal was like a mini celebration for us for arriving Chicago,
  the waitress even helped us to cook our meal.

  The first day was awesome so far, I recommend using hotwire, yelp, and Google
  Maps when planning for road trips.

## 2nd day

  We started our second day around 10am (wanted to wake up earlier though). Had
  an awesome breakfast buffet before going to our first checkpoint Millennium
  Park.

  Just like every other tourists, we took tons of pictures, well my girlfriend
  did. I am just people watching. I'll let the pictures tell the rest of the
  story from here.

  Continuing our planned trip, we decided to go and have lunch at Chinatown.
  The one in Chicago feels like every other Chinatown I have been to in the US.
  Crowded and waiters with thick accent serving us at the restaurant. We had
  dim sum at Ming Hin restaurant and it was tasty. The only downside was the
  Malay cake we ordered, Malaysia's Malay Cake is wayyyy better than the one
  that is served here.

  Now we are ready to go 360 observation deck and walk along the Magnificient
  Mile (shopping and such). One thing I want to highlight about Chicago drivers,
  I noticed all of them are in a hurry, as if they are on an important mission
  to save the world. All of them. Downtown view looks nice though. Good place to
  take pictures.

  All right, we finally have a feel of of Chicago downtown. What's that? Energy
  bar running low? Okay Yelp saved the day again, Silver Spoon Thai Restaurant
  it is.

  We were suppose to walk along Navy Pier but at this point it was getting
  chilly and it is getting dark. Instead of walking we just drove at Navy Pier
  until the end of the road and went back to the hotel.

  The second day was the heart of the trip. The only things we oversee were
  parking spots and restaurant to go. In all honesty, impromptu planning isn't
  all that bad~

## 3rd day

  We concluded our trip by having lunch with my classmate and his girlfriend at
  Yu's Mandarin. The food is really good, too bad we did not take any pictures.

  Overall we spent about $250 per person for this trip, it is really not bad at
  all. I'd say this road trip is pretty well planned and went smoothly. It is a good
  trip to relax after a stressful semester, I believe mini - vacations make you
  feel happier rather long vacations. Stay happy everyone!
