Are you an aspiring game developer looking to create your own epic [text-based adventure game](https://github.com/liewsanmin/text_based_world/)? Look no further, because ChatGPT is here to help!

First, let's start by outlining the basic structure of our game. We'll have a player character who is stranded on an alien planet and must navigate through various locations to find resources and repair their spaceship in order to return home. To make things more interesting, we'll also include a variety of strange creatures and objects that the player can interact with.

Next, it's time to start coding! ChatGPT was an invaluable resource throughout this process, providing guidance and suggestions on how to implement various features and mechanics. For example, ChatGPT helped me to design a system for moving the player between locations and interacting with objects and characters within those locations.

```
void Player::move(std::string new_location) {
    location_name = new_location;
    std::cout << "You have moved to " << new_location << "!\n";
}
```

One of the most challenging aspects of developing this game was creating the different locations that the player could explore. ChatGPT provided suggestions on how to design the various locations, such as a crash site, an alien city, and an underground cave system. Each location had its own unique objects and characters that the player could interact with, adding to the overall immersive experience of the game.

```
#include <map>
#include <string>
class Cave {
public:
    std::string cave_name;
    Cave(std::string name);
    // Map of object numbers to object names
    std::map<int, std::string> objects;
    void prompt();
};
```

As I continued to work on the game, ChatGPT provided helpful tips on optimizing the code and improving the overall gameplay experience. It was truly amazing to see the game come to life with the help of ChatGPT's expertise and guidance.
