Another summer, another exciting experience! This past summer, I was lucky
enough to work at Polaris Industries as an Electrical Engineering intern. The
 powersports industry was definitely a brand new experience transitioning from
 industrial automation industry (Turck). Though I can’t share much of the
 products I worked on, some perks of working at a Powersports is definitely the
 chance to ride an ATV, attend tours, and get hands on experience to state of
 the art powersports vehicle.

In the era closing into electric vehicles, Polaris is also not backing out on
this trend. If you think Polaris is only good for their snowmobile and ATVs, you
haven’t seen their current electric vehicles on the market. They have some neat
collection of electric vehicles.

Working at Polaris is surely great and exhilarating because everyone is so
passionate and all fired up about what they are working on!
